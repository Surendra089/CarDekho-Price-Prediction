# Used Car Price Prediction Model

This project builds a  **Machine Learning Model** to predict the selling price of used cars based on key features. It helps sellers set optimal prices for faster sales and buyers find competitive deals, making the used car market smarter and more efficient! 🚀

## Problem Statement

India’s used car market is dynamic and constantly evolving, with prices fluctuating based on make, model, mileage, condition, and market trends. This unpredictability makes it challenging for sellers to set the right price, leading to potential underpricing or overpricing. A smart pricing model can bridge this gap!

## Dataset

Our model is trained on a dataset from CarDekho.com, featuring detailed specifications of used cars. Key attributes include:

- `car_name`: Name or title of the car (includes model or variant).
- `brand`: The manufacturer or brand of the car (e.g., Toyota, Honda).
- `model`: Specific model of the car.
- `vehicle_age`: Age of the vehicle in years.
- `km_driven`: Total kilometers driven by the car.
- `seller_type`: Type of seller (e.g., individual or dealer).
- `fuel_type`: Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel, electric).
- `transmission_type`: Type of transmission (e.g., manual, automatic).
- `mileage`: Fuel efficiency of the car in km/l.
- `engine`: Engine size or capacity in liters.
- `max_power`: Maximum power produced by the engine (in horsepower).
- `seats`: Number of seats in the car.
- `selling_price`: Target variable, representing the price of the car.

This dataset enables our ML model to analyze key factors affecting car prices, helping sellers price their cars accurately and buyers find the best deals! 🚀
## Objective

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on key features. It will help:

- **Sellers:** Price their cars competitively to attract buyers.
- **Buyers**: Make informed decisions with data-driven price insights.
- **Market Efficienc**y: Ensure transparent and fair pricing for all.

By leveraging real-world data and ML algorithms, this model enhances pricing accuracy, making the used car market smarter and more efficient! 🚀

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing 🛠️
   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Encode categorical features (**brand, fuel_type, seller_type**)
   - Normalize/standardize numerical features (**vehicle_age, km_driven, mileage**)

### 2. Feature Engineering 🔍
   - Create new features like **vehicle_age** from the manufacturing year
   - Extract insights from **car_name** (e.g., model year, variant)

### 3. Model Selection 🧠
   - Experiment with **Linear Regression** and other ML models
   - Evaluate using **MAE, MSE, and R²** to select the best model

### 4. Model Evaluation & Tuning 🎯
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   - Optimize hyperparameters for better accuracy

### 5. Prediction & Deployment 🌐
   - Use the trained model for **real-time price prediction**
   - Deploy as a **web application** for user-friendly access
This approach ensures a **robust, data-driven pricing mechanism**, making the **used car market more transparent and efficient! 🚗💡**
